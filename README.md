# Image Background Removal

This project is a Python-based image processing application that allows you to remove the background of an image using the power of Python and the rembg tool and pillow library.
## Features
 The script analyzes the image and applies an algorithm to automatically detect and remove the background, resulting in a foreground image with a transparent background.
